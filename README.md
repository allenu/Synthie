# Synthie

Synthie is an 8-bit style synth audio/music player. It's a work in progress.

For more information, read blog posts here:

This README file will be updated as the blog posts come out and as new functionality is added.


# Some quick background

In 2011, I decided to write a synth music player for a retro game engine I was working on at the time.

I got GoatTracker music playing. Here's a demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEUSqySKMCU
In 2013, I put together a simple piano player app: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iymaYUtI9_o
 
In 2018, I decided to write this again from the ground up for education purposes. I'll be updating
my blog to explain the process (see link above). 

The code will be usable on any platform, so long as you have a way to play PCM audio samples. In
this project I'll be targeting macOS, iOS, and Raspberry Pi (why not) and possibly Arduino as well
(also why not).


# TODOs

For most of my personal projects, I keep track of tasks using a simple TODO markdown file. Open up
TODO.md to see what upcoming tasks I've created for myself.

I'll try to maintain a LOG.md file as well with notes on what the next steps will be.
